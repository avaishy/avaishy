Yes @bhanu Actually we are facing some vulnabirity regards some java script package 
	Source Package	Package Version	Status
	micromatch	3.1.10	fixed in 4.0.8
	cross-spawn	7.0.3	6.0.6,fixed in 7.0.5
	elliptic	6.5.5	fixed in 6.5.6
	braces	2.3.2	fixed in 3.0.3
	braces	3.0.2	fixed in 3.0.3
	tar	6.2.0	fixed in 6.2.1
	ssri	7.1.1	6.0.2,fixed in 8.0.1
	webpack	4.46.0	fixed in 5.94.0
	find-my-way	8.1.0	8.2.2,fixed in 9.0.1
	@grpc/grpc-js	1.10.3	1.8.22,1.9.15,fixed in 1.10.9
we fix that and push our lastest changes to main and deploy it but when we rescan it those vulnabirity didn't fix.
My question is should we have to upgrade one-app version as when we are currently using 6.13.0 and if yes which one is tha lastest
