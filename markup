# **Credit Risk Assessment: Moderate Risk**

- The customer demonstrates several positive credit signals, including zero non-approved spend, high and stable arbitrated income, low external credit utilization, no external delinquency triggers, and a history of repaying large mortgage loans.  
- However, there are notable risk factors: a sharp increase in the revolve index (from 0 to 20), rising internal utilization (from 50% to 60%), increasing exposure over income ratio (reaching the 90th percentile), and a moderately elevated out-of-pattern ratio.  
- Spending is highly concentrated in the lodging industry, particularly at luxury hotels, with limited diversification into typical business-related merchants. There is also a shift from full to partial payment of monthly spend.  
- The customer’s external credit line is high and stable, and payment history shows no return payments, but recent payment activity is minimal.  
- The transaction pattern reveals a move toward more frequent, smaller purchases, but overall spend remains stable.  

**Conclusion:**  
The customer presents a **moderate credit risk profile**. While there are strong positive indicators of creditworthiness and compliance, the increasing reliance on revolving credit, rising exposure ratios, and concentrated spending in luxury lodging suggest emerging risk factors that warrant monitoring.

# **Credit Risk Assessment: Non-Approved Spend Pattern**

## **Overview**
- The metric analyzed is the ratio of non-approved spend to approved spend for the unpaid period.
- A value above 0 is considered high and indicates increased risk due to non-approved spending.
- The values provided are for eight months ago and seven months ago.

## **Observed Pattern**
- **Eight months ago:** The ratio was 0.0.  
- **Seven months ago:** The ratio remained at 0.0.

## **Analysis**
- **Consistent Zero Ratio:** For both periods, the customer had no non-approved spend relative to approved spend during the unpaid period.  
- **Absence of High-Risk Behavior:** The lack of non-approved spend suggests the customer strictly adhered to approved usage, which is required for small business credit card accounts.  
- **Stable Spending Pattern:** The unchanged ratio over consecutive months indicates a stable and compliant spending pattern.

## **Credit Risk Implications**
- **Low Risk from Non-Approved Spend:** The customer did not engage in non-approved spending during the periods analyzed, minimizing risk associated with unauthorized or prohibited usage.  
- **Positive Indicator for Creditworthiness:** The consistent zero ratio over time reflects responsible card usage and adherence to business-only spending policies.

## **Conclusion**
The customer's pattern of non-approved spend over time demonstrates compliance with credit card usage policies and does not present elevated credit risk based on the provided data.

# **Credit Risk Assessment: Normalized Total Spend Weighted by Merchant Credit-to-Gross Ratio**

## **Variable Overview**
- This reflects the riskiness of spend based on merchant credit practices.  
- **Higher values** indicate spending at merchants where deferred payment is common, suggesting increased credit risk.

### **Percentile thresholds**
- **10th percentile:** -6.966 (low risk)  
- **50th percentile:** 0.066 (median)  
- **90th percentile:** 0.393 (high risk)

## **Customer's Spend Pattern**
- **Eight months ago:** 0.335  
- **Seven months ago:** 0.372

## **Analysis**
- Both values are **above the median (0.066)**, indicating consistent spending at merchants where deferred payment is prevalent.  
- The values are **close to the 90th percentile (0.393)**, placing the customer in the **upper-middle risk segment**.  
- The **increase from 0.335 to 0.372** suggests a **rising trend in risk**, with growing exposure to merchants offering lenient credit terms.

## **Summary**
The customer's spend pattern shows **elevated and increasing credit risk**, with consistent activity above the median and near the high-risk threshold — highlighting a potential upward risk trend.

# **Credit Risk Assessment: Arbitrated Income Pattern**

## **Income Level Analysis**
- **Eight months ago:** $360K  
- **Seven months ago:** $360K  
- This is **above the 90th percentile ($320K)** — placing the customer in the top income bracket.

## **Income Stability**
- Income remained **constant** over both months — showing stability.  
- No volatility or decline observed.

## **Relative Position**
- The customer’s income is well above both the **median ($125K)** and **low threshold ($60K)**.  

## **Risk Implications**
- **High and stable income = low credit risk**.  
- The steady income trend supports strong repayment capacity.

### **Summary**
The customer maintains a **consistently high and stable income** (above the 90th percentile) with no signs of decline — a **positive risk indicator**.

# **Credit Risk Assessment: Revolve Index Pattern**

## **Overview**
- Measures unpaid balance carryover month-to-month.  
- **10th percentile:** 0 (low)  
- **50th percentile:** 0.02 (median)  
- **90th percentile:** 9.12 (high)

## **Customer’s History**
- **Eight months ago:** 0  
- **Seven months ago:** 20 (well above 90th percentile)

## **Pattern Analysis**
- A sharp rise from 0 → 20 in one month = **sudden shift from no revolving to high revolving**.  
- Indicates large unpaid balances carried forward.

## **Credit Risk Implications**
- Significant increase signals **rising credit dependence** and possible **cash flow stress**.  
- A revolve index of 20 implies **substantial revolving behavior**, indicating higher risk.

### **Summary**
A drastic shift from full repayment to large revolving balances represents a **major risk escalation**.

# **Credit Risk Assessment: Clarity Credit Score (Experian)**

## **Overview**
- Ranges from 300–850 (higher = lower risk).  
- Evaluates credit risk, especially for customers with limited credit history.

## **Assessment**
- **No score data available** for either of the two months.

## **Implications**
- Missing score suggests **limited credit history** or **insufficient reporting** to bureaus.  
- Without data, risk cannot be quantified using this metric.

### **Conclusion**
The lack of a Clarity Credit Score limits visibility into the customer’s credit behavior, which may itself indicate **potential risk**.

# **Credit Risk Assessment: Exposure Over Income Ratio**

## **Overview**
Measures how leveraged a customer is — the proportion of credit exposure relative to income.

### **Percentiles**
- 10th: 0 (low exposure)  
- 50th: 0.01 (median)  
- 90th: 0.08 (high exposure)

## **Customer Trend**
- **Eight months ago:** 0.07  
- **Seven months ago:** 0.08 (reached high-risk threshold)

## **Analysis**
- The ratio moved from **just below to at the 90th percentile**, showing an upward risk trend.  
- Both values are **well above the median**, meaning the customer is heavily leveraged relative to income.

## **Risk Implications**
- Persistent high exposure = **elevated credit risk**.  
- Indicates a tendency toward over-leverage.

### **Conclusion**
Exposure over income reached the **90th percentile**, signaling **high leverage and growing credit risk**.

# **Credit Risk Assessment: External Credit Utilization History**

## **Overview**
Assesses how much of available credit the customer uses externally.

## **Key Observations**
- **Average Utilization:** 10% for both months → low usage.  
- **High Utilization Trades:** 0 → none above 75% utilization.

## **Credit Risk Implications**
- **Low average utilization** = strong credit discipline.  
- **No high-utilization trades** = minimal dependency on revolving credit.

### **Conclusion**
The customer maintains **low and consistent external credit utilization**, which reflects **prudent credit behavior and low external risk**.
